Induction Motor Drive for Smart Electric Vehicle
This project is about controlling the speed and torque of the induction motor to provide an
automatic control to a smooth ride to the electric vehicle. The system will work in a close
loop to readjust itself quickly by using a micro-controller to provide the system with the best
possible choice of speed to retain or readjust itself. We will be using SVPWM instead of SPWM
technique because it is superior in advanced technology.
